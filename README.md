I have chosen cell2cell dataset which is open source data provided by Teradata center for customer relationship management published at Duke University.
This data is already preprocessed version which is assessable by anyone for analysis. This dataset consists of 58 attributes and 71,047 instance.
This dataset encompasses a wide range of attributes, including demographic information, usage patterns, billing details, customer interactions, and potentially more.
